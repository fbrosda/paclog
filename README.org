#+title: Visualizations of pacman logs

Did you ever wonder, which packages you installed when, who long they are kept on your system, or which package gets the most frequent updates?  If you are using Arch Linux you can use the information of ~/var/cache/pacman.log~ to generate some nice images to answer these questions.

This repository contains to script to extract the interesting information from the pacman log:
- ~pacman_parse.py~ :: Reads the file ~data/pacman.log~ and writes ~data/pacman_history.csv~, which contains the package install/uninstall/update events in a easier to work with format.
- ~pacman_visualize.py~ :: This script generates a number of svg files stored in ~visualizations/~, based on the data in the ~pacman_history.csv~
